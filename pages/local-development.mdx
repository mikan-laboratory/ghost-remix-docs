# Local Development

Find the code [here](https://github.com/mikan-laboratory/ghost-remix).

## Dependencies

Before you begin local development, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): A package manager for JavaScript, used to install and manage project dependencies.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated environments (containers).
- [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/): An essential tool for managing microservice development with support for Docker.

## Local Development Setup

To set up your local development environment, follow these steps:

### Get the code

Use the template to create your own repository.

#### GitHub UI

- Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/mikan-laboratory/ghost-remix), click `Use this template`, and follow the instructions.

#### GitHub CLI

- Get the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the template repository

git clone https://github.com/mikab-laboratory/ghost-remix.git new-project

cd new-project

# Step 2: Create a new repository on GitHub

gh repo create username/new-project --private --source=.

# Step 3: Push the cloned contents to the new repository

git push --set-upstream origin main
```

### Mailgun

You don't need Mailgun to get started, but you'll need for email-based workflows like member sign up.
Don't worry about the $35 a month price tag, immediately after signing up for the trial, you can downgrade to the flex plan.

1. Create [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account.

2. Navigate to Sending -> Domains. You should see a test domain that looks like `sandbox1234567890abcdef1234567890ab.mailgun.org`

3. Add your email as an authorized recipient.

4. Scroll down and select API Keys. Create a new API key and copy the key.

5. Find the correct base URL [here](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-intro.html#base-url).

### Create an env file

You'll need to create a .env file in the project root, using .env.example as a guide.

### Start Tilt

This will install dependencies, generate a prisma client, and start all services.

```bash
tilt up
```

### Seed

Use the Seed button in the Ghost section of the Tilt UI to populate basic data.

- The production script seeds an owner and basic settings. The development script includes posts and comments.
- If you want to inspect the database, you can manually trigger a GUI from the Tilt UI.

### Engine

The Node engine is set to 18.19 in package.json to match the production runtime. This follows the Ghost team's advice. You can find more information [here](https://ghost.org/docs/faq/node-versions/#why-follow-lts).
Using a different version locally shouldn't be an issue, but you will see a warning when you run `npm install`. If you want to use this version in development, you can use a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script) to manage multiple Node versions.

### Theme

You can change the theme colors in `app/theme/theme.ts`.

### Favicon

You can replace the favicon.ico with your own in the public folder. If you are using a PNG, you will need to add `<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.png" type="image/png" />` to the `<head>` component under `<Meta/>` in the `root.tsx` file. If you are unsure about turning your logo into a favicon, we used [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) to do it for free.

### Pages

Published pages are automatically added to the menu in the navigation bar.

### Test Docker Build

Ensure your Docker build is correctly configured:

#### Build

Execute the build process:

```bash
make all
```

#### Cleanup

After testing, clean up the build environment:

```bash
make clean-all
```

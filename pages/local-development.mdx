# Local Development

## Dependencies

Before you begin local development, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): A package manager for JavaScript, used to install and manage project dependencies.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated environments (containers).
- [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/): An essential tool for managing microservice development with support for Docker.

## Local Development Setup

To set up your local development environment, follow these steps:

### Note

You don't need Mailgun to get started, but you'll need for email-based workflows like member sign up.
Don't worry about the $35 a month price tag, immediately after signing up for the trial, you can downgrade to the flex plan.

1. Create [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account.

2. Navigate to Sending -> Domains. You should see a test domain that looks like `sandbox1234567890abcdef1234567890ab.mailgun.org`

3. Add your email as an authorized recipient.

4. Scroll down and select API Keys. Create a new API key and copy the key.

5. Find the correct base URL [here](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-intro.html#base-url).

### Get the code

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the template repository

git clone https://github.com/username/template-repository.git new-project

cd new-project

# Step 2: Create a new repository on GitHub

gh repo create username/new-project --public --source=.

# Step 3: Push the cloned contents to the new repository

git push --set-upstream origin main
```

### Create an env file

You'll need to create a .env file in the project root, using .env.example as a guide.

### Start Tilt

First, initiate Tilt to orchestrate your microservices:

```bash
tilt up
```

### Seed

Use the Seed button in the Ghost section of the Tilt UI to populate basic data.

### Test Docker Build

Ensure your Docker build is correctly configured:

#### Build

Execute the build process:

```bash
make all
```

#### Cleanup

After testing, clean up the build environment:

```bash
make clean-all
```

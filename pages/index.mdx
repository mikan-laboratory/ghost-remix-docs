Welcome to the documentation website for GhostRemix. GhostRemix is an open source project by [Mikan Labs](https://mikanlabs.com) that uses the popular blog [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) as a headless CMS with [Remix](https://remix.run/).

We built GhostRemix for two reasons. We thought Ghost could provide a good foundation for the kind of blog we wanted to build, and we saw issues developers experienced with self-hosting and headless setups and thought we could help.
If you want to know more about some of the design decisions, check out [this](https://mikanlabs.com/ghost-remix) post.

We built this project to be easy to extend and deploy. If you find it useful, we'd appreciate it if you gave us a [‚≠ê](https://github.com/mikan-laboratory/ghost-remix).

To get started with GhostRemix start [here](/local-development). For a full list of features check [here](/features).

If you just want an easy way to work with and deploy vanilla Ghost, we've got you covered [here](/vanilla-ghost).

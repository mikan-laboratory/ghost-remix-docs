# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation website for Ghost Remix. Ghost Remix is an open source project by Mikan Labs that uses the popular blog Ghost as a headless CMS with Remix.

We built Ghost Remix for two reasons. We thought Ghost could provide a good foundation for the kind of blog we wanted to build, and we saw some issues developers experienced with self-hosting and headless setups and thought we could help.
If you want to know more about some of the design decisions, check out [this](https://mikanlabs.com) post.

We built this project to be easy to extend and deploy. If you find this useful, we'd appreciate it if you gave the repository a [‚≠ê](https://github.com/mikan-laboratory/ghost-remix).

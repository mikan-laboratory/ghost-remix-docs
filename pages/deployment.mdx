# Deployment

The project is set up to be easily deployed to Fly.io, so this guide will explain this workflow.

    ## Prerequisites

    1. Create an account at [Fly.io](https://fly.io).
    2. Download [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/): Fly.io command line tool
    3. Authenticate with `flyctl auth login`
    4. In the root of the project run `flyctl launch --no-deploy`. This will create prompt you to create an application on Fly.io with the information provided in the `fly.toml`.
    You will be asked if you want to update these settings. Here you can choose a server location that is more relevant. Ensure that the port is set to `8080`.

    ### Tip

    You can use the following commands to generate your GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY and JWT_SECRET

    ```bash
    # GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY - follows format Ghost generates
    node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(13).toString('hex'))"
    # JWT_SECRET
    node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
    ```

## Github Actions

For deployment through GitHub Actions:

1. **Get Deploy API Token**: Navigate to the newly created application in the Fly.io dashboard and get a deploy token.

2. **Set Secrets**: Configure necessary secrets in your GitHub repository settings.

3. Manually trigger by going to Actions tab and selecting `Fly Deploy`. Click `Run workflow` and enter the branch name to deploy.
   - You can update this action to trigger on push to `main` by changing the `on` section of the workflow file to `push: [main]`

## Command Line

For command line deployment:

### Set Secrets

Configure necessary environment secrets:

```
flyctl secrets set GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY="my-api-key-value" \
   OWNER_EMAIL="my-email-value" \
   OWNER_PASSWORD="my-password-value" \
   MAILGUN_DOMAIN="somedomain" \
   MAILGUN_API_KEY="somekey" \
   MAILGUN_BASE_URL="mailgunbase" \
   MAILGUN_USER="postmaster@somedomain \
   MAILGUN_PASSWORD="password" \
   JWT_SECRET="somejwtsecret" \
   SITE_TITLE="My Site" \
   SITE_DESCRIPTION="My website" \
   OWNER_NAME="Admin" \
   OWNER_SLUG="admin" \
   BLOG_URL="https://mysite.com" \
   COMMENT_SETTINGS="all" \
   MEMBERS_SIGNUP_ACCESS="all" \
   RAPID_READ="post" \
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="somekey" \
   IMAGE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY="/var/www/ghost/content/images/"
```

### Deploy

Deploy your application with environment variables:

```bash
flyctl deploy
```

## Custom Domains and SSL

More details [here](https://fly.io/docs/networking/custom-domains-with-fly/)

1. List your app ip addreses with `flyctl ips list`.

2. Create SSL certificates.

```
flyctl certs create mysite.com
flyctl certs create www.mysite.com
```

3. Use the ipv4 address to create an A record in your DNS provider, and the ipv6 address to create a AAAA record. Create a CNAME record for `www`.

## Caching Strategies

GhostRemix employs a two-pronged caching approach to optimize performance:

1. Remix Application Caching:

   - Utilizes an in-memory cache for dynamic content.
   - Handles its own cache invalidation for up-to-date data.

2. Nginx Static Asset Handling:

   - Serves static assets directly from the filesystem.
   - Bypasses the Ghost server for serving images, leveraging Nginx's efficiency in handling static files.

This dual strategy ensures efficient handling of both dynamic content and static assets, significantly reducing strain on the Remix application server.
